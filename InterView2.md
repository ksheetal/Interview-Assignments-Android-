`Using the free version of **apixu weather API**, make a simple weather app that shows current temperature along with the temperature forecast for the next 4 days (average temperature for each day should be shown for the forecast).  All temperatures are in celsius. The temperature should be shown for the current location of the user.`


### Must haves
 - Your app should have min SDK as 16 since that’s what we need to target in emerging markets with low spec devices (We know it’s scary. Don’t worry. You can do this)
- UI and UX should match closely to the spec. We wanna see that you can do simple animations and follow design guidelines.
 - A well known architecture pattern. You can use MVP, MVVM or any other architecture commonly used in the Android world.
 - Good test coverage. We’d like to see some unit tests with JUnit and UI tests with Espresso that test the core functionality of the app.
- A sensible git history. The easiest way for us to follow your thought process is to follow your git history.


### Nice to haves

We use these things. Not a strict requirement but you’ll have to learn them eventually anyway once you’re working with us:

- OkHttp and Retrofit for networking
- Dagger for dependency injection
- Mockito and MockWebServer for mocking objects and network requests respectively in tests
