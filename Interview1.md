### Todo App:
### Role - Android Developer (Internship)
###  Time - 24 HR after receiving the assignment.
Create an app to manage Todo tasks. The tasks are to be divided into two categories - Today and
Later​. Show the list of Pending​ and Completed​ tasks separately for each category.
Scope​:
- The app should have a screen that has two tabs - Today​ & Later​.
- Data in both tabs should be displayed in a similar format.
- Each Tab contains a list of Todo tasks organised into separate sections for Pending items
and Completed items​.
- The list of Todo items shown in each tab should be in chronological order.
- The list should be scrollable so that all the tasks can be seen by the user of the app (keep in
mind while developing that the number of items is not fixed).
- The app should make a GET request to XXXXXXXXXXX to get the sample data to display.
The response would be a list of Todo tasks. Each Todo task contains following fields:
id ​- integer
description ​- string
scheduledDate ​- format yyyyMMddHHmm
status ​- PENDING or COMPLETED
- A Todo item can be marked as PENDING or COMPLETED based on current status. As
shown in mockup, there should be a checkbox/radio button or similar component with each
item on clicking on which the status would change and list should refresh immediately.

Instructions​:
- You may use external libraries or tools for building
or testing purposes, however, you should be able to justify
its usage.
- You may choose your own assets/colours for the
app. It need not look exactly the same as shown in
the mockup.
- Keep the design simple and code readable. Focus
on using proper naming conventions.
- Focus on keeping the good architecture of the app,
good object modelling and minimum redundancy in code.
Try to reuse.
- Try to model in such a way that functionalities
remain extensible. Any extension to functionality should be
simple and should not involve a lot of existing code
change.
- While we are looking for a working solution at the
end, the approach you take while building the app matters
a lot. Follow the recommended practices for app
development keeping in mind the above instructions.
